            Visual studio is a studio that you can use to code offline. It is one of my favorite studios to use to code, and also features things like auto finishing. if you write, for example, and html tag, it will auto complete it for you.

The console is basically a something that a lot of developers use to test. It is used to print things, create mathmatical functions, and other stuff. If you want to become a good website developer, I recommend using the console.

            var first_name = "Ranbir"
            var last_name = " Kapoor"
            console.log(first_name.concat(last_name));
            var a = 20;
            var b = 50;
            var add = (a + b);
            console.log(add);
